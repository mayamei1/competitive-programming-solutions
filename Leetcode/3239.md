## _Solution:_
Simply count number of "palindromic differences" between all rows, and count the number of the differences between all columns, then return the minimum of the two.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        int ans0 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m / 2; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != grid[i][m - j - 1]) ans0++;
            }
        }

        int ans1 = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != grid[n - i - 1][j]) ans1++;
            }
        }

        return min(ans0, ans1);
    }
};
