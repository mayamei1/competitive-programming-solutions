## _Solution:_
Have a table that keeps track of the frequency of each digit for each position. Then, for each number in each location, accumulate $freq\times (n-freq)$ -- there are $freq$ of the current number, paired with $n-freq$ of not the current number. Divide by two at the end since ordering of the pairing does not matter.

            tmp /= 10;
            m++;
        }
