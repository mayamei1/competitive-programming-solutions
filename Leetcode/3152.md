## _Solution:_
Keep a running sum of the number of adjacent pairs that have the same parity/fails. For each query, find the number of fails via the running sum, and if it is zero, it is special.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> isArraySpecial(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> fail(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            fail[i] += fail[i - 1];
            fail[i] += nums[i] % 2 == nums[i - 1] % 2;
        }
        
        int q = queries.size();
        vector<bool> ans(q);
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            int l = queries[i][0], r = queries[i][1];
            int num_fails = fail[r] - fail[l];
            ans[i] = num_fails == 0;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
