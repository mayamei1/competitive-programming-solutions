## _Solution:_
Check if each column has equal elements. Check if the first row does not have elements that are the same as its neighbors.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool satisfiesConditions(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != grid[i-1][j]) return false;
            }
        }
        
        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            if (grid[0][j] == grid[0][j-1]) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
