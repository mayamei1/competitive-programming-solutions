## _Solution:_
For now, disregard any single middle rows or columns. In order for rows and columns to be palindromic, we need symmetry across both axes, so there are four cells we need to compare. Perform the operations on the smaller frequency between the four cells. This always guarantees divisibility of 4. Now, for handling odd lengths, if $n$ and $m$ are odd, the middle point *must* be 0, since it would make the count odd, and there would be no further way of flipping parity. With a middle row/column, count the number of already paired 1's and the number of palindromic differences. If we performed a non-zero number of operations for either middle row/column, we can guarantee a result that is divisible by 4. However, if both performed 0 operations, and there are an odd number of paired 1's, then we must perform 2 extra operations.
