## _Solution:_
Can be implemented in similar ways to some longest path of a tree algorithms. DFS starting from the root, the longest path is either the two longest paths from children, or the longest distance that is under the child's subtree. The DFS at each node returns two values, the longest path that includes the current node and the longest path in the subtree. The longest path that includes the current node can be calculated by finding the child with the longest path that includes itself, plus one. The longest path in the subtree is either the longest path of any of the children, or the two children with the longest paths that includes themselves, plus 1.
