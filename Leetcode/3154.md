## _Solution:_
Do a recursive DP, where the states are number of first operation, number of second operation, and the last operation performed. The stair that you are on can be determined by those states, or can be calculated and sent through as a function parameter. At each state, count up the number of ways you can get to $k$ if you performed either operation. Base case is if the current stair that you are on is over $k+1$, since you could never go back down once you get to that point. If you reach $k$, you still need to continue searching moves, as you could could potentially still get to $k$ with more moves. However, if you do reach $k$, then you can increment that answer for that state by one.
