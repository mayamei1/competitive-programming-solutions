## _Solution:_
Observe that you will always want to perform the cut with the highest cost first, in order to minimize the amount of times that you need to perform that cut. Then, if there are multiple cuts (in either direction) with the same amount costs, then it does not matter which ones you do first. Observe that no matter which order you perform the operations, it ultimately can be defined as `c*(vcnt*vfreq[c]+hcnt*hfreq[c]+vfreq[c]*hfreq[c])`, where `c` is the cost, `vcnt` and `hcnt` the number of elements that need to be cut through vertically/horizontally at the beginning of the operations, and `vfreq[c]` and `hfreq[c]` are the number of times that `c` appears as a cost in the vertical/horizontal directions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumCost(int m, int n, vector<int>& hCut, vector<int>& vCut) {
        long long vcnt = 1, hcnt = 1;

        long long ans = 0;
        vector<int> vfreq(1005), hfreq(1005);
        for (int c : hCut) vfreq[c]++;
        for (int c : vCut) hfreq[c]++;

        for (int i = 1000; i >= 1; i--) {
            ans += (i * vcnt * vfreq[i]) + (i * (hcnt + vfreq[i]) * hfreq[i]);
            hcnt += vfreq[i];
            vcnt += hfreq[i];
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
