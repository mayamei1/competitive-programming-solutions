## _Solution:_
A number is special if and only if they are a prime squared. You can iterate through each prime and count squared primes between $l$ and $r$.

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-count-of-numbers-which-are-not-special/
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int nonSpecialCount(int l, int r) {
        vector<bool> is_prime(1e5, 1);
        vector<long long> primes;
        for (long long i = 2; i < 1e5; i++) {
            if (!is_prime[i]) continue;
            for (long long j = i * i; j < 1e5; j += i) is_prime[j] = 0;
            primes.push_back(i);
        }

        int sp = 0;
        for (long long p : primes) {
            if (l <= p * p && p * p <= r) sp++;
        }

        return (r - l + 1) - sp;
    }
};
