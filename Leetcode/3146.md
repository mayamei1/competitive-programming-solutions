## _Solution:_
Create an array for the indices of each letter for each string. Then, calculate the absolute difference of each letter index.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPermutationDifference(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> s_i(26);
        vector<int> t_i(26);
        
        for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {
            s_i[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; t[i]; i++) {
            t_i[t[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            ans += abs(s_i[i] - t_i[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
