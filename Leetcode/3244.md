## _Solution:_
Since no to queries overlap, we can keep a set of all vertices, and as we process each query, we remove every vertex between $l+1$ and $r-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int q = queries.size();

        vector<int> ans(q);
        set<int> nodes;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) nodes.insert(i);
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            int u = queries[i][0], v = queries[i][1];
            auto l = nodes.upper_bound(u);
            auto r = nodes.lower_bound(v);
            nodes.erase(l, r);
            ans[i] = nodes.size() - 1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
