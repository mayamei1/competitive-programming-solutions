Do one pass through to see if any players can get $K$ wins. If none of them do, then the player with the largest number will get $K$ wins.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findWinningPlayer(vector<int>& skills, int k) {
        int n = skills.size();
        
        int idx = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (skills[i] > skills[idx]) {
                idx = i;
                cnt = 1;
            } else {
                cnt++;
            }
            
            if (cnt == k) {
                return idx;
            }
        }
        
        return idx;
    }
