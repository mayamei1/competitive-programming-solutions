## _Solution:_
Observe that for a valid subsequence, you every number at even indices must be modular equivalent, and the same goes for odd indices. Thus, you can keep track of a DP table with two states, $v$ being the the last mod value in the sequence and $u$ being the opposite parity's mod value, keeping track of the maximum subsequence length provided the given states. Then, iterate through each $a_i$, and given that $v=a_{i}\mod{2}$, iterate through $u$ and update `dp[v][u]=max(dp[v][u], dp[u][v] + 1)`, and finally return the largest value in the DP table.

```cpp
const int K = 2;
int dp[K][K];

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int k = 2;
        
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int v = nums[i] % k;
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                dp[j][v] = max(dp[j][v], dp[v][j] + 1);
                ans = max(ans, dp[j][v]);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
