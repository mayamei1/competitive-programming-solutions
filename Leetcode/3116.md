## _Solution:_
Note that if we have some value $v$ to be the limit for the value of coins, we can calculate the number of coins through the set-union formula in $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of denominations. We can binary search $v$, and if the number of coins $k_v$ equals $k$, then $v$ *may* be a valid answer. In order to guarantee that we get a valid answer, we need to get the minimum $v$ such that $k_v=k$. If $k_{v}\ge k$, you are or may be searching too high, and if $k_v<k$, you are searching too low. Set-union can be found with inclusion-exclusion principle.

You can pre-calculate the number that each intersection cycles by and store it in a list, so during the binary search, you can calculate how many cycles there are for each intersection that is under $v$. The intersection of any number of sets is simply the LCM of the each denomination.
