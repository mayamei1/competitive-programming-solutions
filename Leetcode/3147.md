## _Solution:_
Notice that if you work backwards, you can "running sum" jumping $k$ steps, so that when you do a jump, you can pretend this is a starting point. Do this for offsets of every value of $\mod k$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumEnergy(vector<int>& energy, int k) {
        int mx = -1000000000;
        int n = energy.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int ii = n - i - 1;
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = ii; j >= 0; j -= k) {
                sum += energy[j];
                mx = max(mx, sum);
            }
        }
        return mx;
    }
};
