## _Solution:_
Keep count of the frequency of each number, then XOR every number with exactly two occurrences.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int duplicateNumbersXOR(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> freq(51);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            freq[nums[i]]++;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
            if (freq[i] == 2) ans ^= i;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
