## _Solution:_
Keep count of states $(x_i,y_i)$ and a set of winning players. Once the count of $(x_i,y_i)$ is greater than $x_i$, then add $x_i$ to the set.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int winningPlayerCount(int n, vector<vector<int>>& pick) {
        map<pair<int, int>, int> cnt;
        set<int> vis;

        for (auto& c : pick) {
            int p = c[0], b = c[1];
            if (cnt[{p, b}] == p) vis.insert(p);
            cnt[{p, b}]++;
            
        }

        return vis.size();
    }
};
