```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        int val = nums[0] + nums[1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i += 2) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i - 1] == val) ans++;
            else break;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
