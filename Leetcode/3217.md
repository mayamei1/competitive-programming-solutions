## _Solution:_
Update head to be the first element that is not in the `nums` set. Then, iterate through the rest of the list and perform deletions as needed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* modifiedList(vector<int>& nums, ListNode* head) {
        set<int> a(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        while (a.count(head->val)) head = head->next;

        ListNode* prev = head;
        ListNode* cur = head->next;
        while (cur) {
            if (a.count(cur->val)) {
                prev->next = cur->next;
                cur = cur->next;
            } else {
                prev = cur;
                cur = cur->next;
            }
        }

        return head;
    }
};
```
