## _Solution:_
Keep track of two counts of even/odd rows. Increment counts accordingly and compare the max of the counts with the max of red/blue, as well as the minimums.

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-height-of-a-triangle/
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxHeightOfTriangle(int red, int blue) {
        int c1 = 0, c2 = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        bool t = false;

        while (true) {
            t = !t;
            cnt++;
            if (t) c1 += cnt;
            else c2 += cnt;
            if (max(red, blue) < max(c1, c2) || min(red, blue) < min(c1, c2)) return cnt - 1;
        }
    }
};
```
