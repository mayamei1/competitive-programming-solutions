## _Solution:_
This problem is almost synonymous to counting the number of ways to go through a $N\times M$ grid from $(0,0)$ to $(N,M)$ with only down or right moves. Note that the limit is the maximum amount that you can walk in one direction before you have to change directions. With the DP approach of the simpler problem (the one without a limit), the two states are the location in the grid, and `dp[x][y]=dp[x-1][y]+dp[x][y-1]`, where $x$ represents $0$, and $y$ represents $1$. However, with the limit, we also need to subtract out those that would need to walk $\mathrm{limit}$ away in one direction to reach $(x,y)$. At `dp[x-limit][y]`, it would include counts that would require to move right a **minimum** of $\mathrm{limit}$ times. However, that "minimum" causes an overcount in how much to subtract by.  If we had another DP state for the "in-direction," or the direction you are walking in from, then you can find out how much we need to subtract by. With `dp[x-limit][y][1]`, we now know the count of those that would need **exactly** $\mathrm{limit}$ right moves.
