## _Solution:_
Keep track of a DP table with the state being the max single power (using a RB-tree because the power can be up to $10^9$. Start by sorting each spell. Iterate through each power and count the number of the current power. Find the highest power that is less than the current power minus 2 via binary search. Find the max of including this power vs not including this power by comparing the last total power calculated vs the minus two's total power plus current power's addition.

    long long maximumTotalDamage(vector<int>& power) {
        int n = power.size();

        map<long long,long long> dp;
        dp[0] = 0;
        long long mx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long long p = power[i];
            int j = i;
            while (j < n && power[j] == power[i]) j++;
            long long cnt = j - i;
            i = j - 1;
            auto itr = dp.lower_bound(p - 2);
            long long ans = max(mx, cnt * p);
            if (itr == dp.begin()) {
