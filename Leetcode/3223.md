## _Solution:_
Keep track of frequency of each character. If at any point the frequency is 3, set it to 1.

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-length-of-string-after-operations/
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        map<char, int> freq;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            freq[s[i]]++;
            if (freq[s[i]] == 3) freq[s[i]] = 1;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (auto [c, f] : freq) ans += f;

        return ans;
    }
};
```
