## _Solution:_
Since it is guaranteed that the `nums2` is equal to `nums1` after the operation, you can simply grab the maximum integer of both arrays, and get the difference.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int addedInteger(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        int max1 = 0, max2 = 0;

        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            max1 = max(max1, nums1[i]);
            max2 = max(max2, nums2[i]);
        }
        
        return max2 - max1;
    }
};
```
