```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(string s) {
        for (int i = 1; s[i]; i++) {
            if (s[i] % 2 == s[i - 1] % 2 && s[i - 1] > s[i]) {
                char t = s[i];
                s[i] = s[i - 1];
                s[i - 1] = t;
                break;
            }
        }

        return s;
    }
