## _Solution:_
Count up the frequency of `hours[i] % 24`. There are `freq[0] * (freq[0] - 1) / 2` to  pair mod 0's. This is also the case with `freq[12] * (freq[12] - 1) / 2` to pair mod 12's. Then pair up `freq[i]` with `freq[24-i]` between 1 and 11 by doing simple multiplication rule.

```cpp
int cnt[24];

class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteDayPairs(vector<int>& hours) {
        int n = hours.size();
        
        memset(cnt, 0, sizeof(cnt));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cnt[hours[i] % 24]++;
        }
        
        int ans = cnt[0] * (cnt[0] - 1) / 2;
        ans += cnt[12] * (cnt[12] - 1) / 2;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 11; i++) {
            ans += cnt[i] * cnt[24 - i];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
