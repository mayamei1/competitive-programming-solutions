## _Solution:_
The only possible combination of coins is $(75,10,10,10,10)$. Thus the number of turns is limited by $\min(x,\lfloor\frac{y}{4}\rfloor)$. If the number of turns is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string losingPlayer(int x, int y) {
        if (min(x, y / 4) % 2) return "Alice";
        return "Bob";
    }
};
```
