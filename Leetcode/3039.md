## _Solution:_
Store the operation number for each character in the string by keeping track of the frequency of each letter. The largest operation number is the last operation, so create a string that only consists of the largest operation number.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string lastNonEmptyString(string s) {
        vector<int> val(s.size());
        vector<int> cnt(26);
        int ma = 0;
        for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {
            cnt[s[i] - 'a']++;
            val[i] = cnt[s[i] - 'a'];
            ma = max(ma, val[i]);
        }
        
        string ans = "";
        for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {
            if (val[i] == ma) ans += s[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
