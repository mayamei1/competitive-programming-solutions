## _Solution:_
We can keep track of the distance squared from the origin of every obstacle. We will only keep track of the $k$ nearest points in a multiset. For each query, add to the multiset and if the multiset's size is greater than $k$, remove the one with the largest distance.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> resultsArray(vector<vector<int>>& queries, int k) {
        int q = queries.size();
        multiset<int> vals;
        vector<int> ans(q, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            int x = queries[i][0], y = queries[i][1];
            vals.insert(abs(x) + abs(y));
            if (vals.size() > k) vals.erase(prev(vals.end()));
            if (vals.size() == k) ans[i] = *vals.rbegin();
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
