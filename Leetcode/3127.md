## _Solution:_
Check every $2\times 2$ grid. The only way to not be able to turn that grid to a single color is if there are exactly $2$ white squares in the grid. If every grid fails the check, the answer is no.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMakeSquare(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
                int count = (grid[i][j] == 'W') + (grid[i+1][j] == 'W') + (grid[i][j+1] == 'W') + (grid[i+1][j+1] == 'W');
                if (count != 2) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
