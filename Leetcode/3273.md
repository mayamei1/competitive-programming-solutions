## _Solution:_
It can be observed that it is optimal to stick to attacking a single enemy until it dies. Then, for determining the order of killing enemies, if we have three enemies $a$, $b$, and $c$, such that it is better to attack $a$ before $b$, and it is better to attack $b$ before $c$, then transitive property is applied and it is better to attack $a$ before $c$. For each enemy $i$, it takes $c_i=\lceil\frac{h_{i}}{p}\rceil$ hits to kill, and it does $d_i$ damage. Thus, it will always do $t_{i}=c_{i}\cdot d_i$ damage, but we want to minimize amount of delay for the largest $t_i$. Thus, for two enemies $i$ and $j$, we can compare the amount of extra damage done if  $i$ goes first as $c_{i}d_{j}$, and $c_{j}d_{i}$ for if $j$ goes first. Then, we can order $i$ based on how those values compare.

using ll = long long;

bool comp(ii& a, ii& b) {
    return a.first * b.second < b.first * a.second;
}

class Solution {
public:

        int n = damage.size();
        vector<ii> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = {(health[i] + power - 1) / power, damage[i]};
        }
        sort(a.begin(), a.end(), comp);

        ll ans = 0;
        ll time = 0;
        for (ii x : a) {
            time += x.first;
            ans += x.second * time;
        }

        return ans;
    }
