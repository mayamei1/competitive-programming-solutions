## _Solution:_
Start by sorting the array. Note that if you have some distance $d$, you can calculate how many pairs are strictly less than $d$ (denoted as $lo$) and how many are strictly more than $d$ (denoted as $hi$) in $O(n)$ time with two pointers. If $lo<k<n-hi$, where $n$ is the size of the array, then that means that the $k$-th distance must be $d$. Binary search can be used to search to determine $d$.

With the two pointer solution, you will iterate through $i$ for the first number in the pair. You will keep track of another two pointers $j$ and $l$ that indicates the number that is has the largest distance that is less than $d$ and the number that is the smallest distance larger than $d$.

public:
    int check(vector<int>& nums, int k, int x) {
        int j = 0, l = 0;
        int lower = 0, higher = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (j < n) {
                if (abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= x) break;
                j++;
            }
            while (l < n) {
                if (abs(nums[i] - nums[l]) > x) break;
                l++;
            }
            lower += j - i - 1;
            higher += n - l;
        }

        if (k <= lower) return 1;
        int cnt = n * (n - 1) / 2;
        if (k > (cnt - higher)) return -1;
        return 0;
    }

    int smallestDistancePair(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int h = 1000000, l = 0, m;

        while (true) {
            m = l + (h - l) / 2;
            int c = check(nums, k, m);
            if (c == 0) return m;
            else if (c == -1) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else {
                h = m - 1;
            }
        }
    }
