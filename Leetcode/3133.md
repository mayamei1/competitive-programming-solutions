## _Solution:_
Every number in the array needs to have at least every $1$ bit in $x$. Due to this, it fully removes those bits from being able to provide any information. So, every $0$ bit in $x$ can be used to encode a number. If we look at just the $0$ bits, then, the $n$-th number needs to be encoded to $n-1$, since the first number is encoded $0$. With this information, we can take the bits of $n-1$ and set them into the least significant bits of $x$ where the bit was originally $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minEnd(int n, int x) {
        long long ans = x;
        long long nl = n - 1;
        int i = 0;
        while (nl) {
            if (!((ans >> i) & 1)) {
                ans |= (nl & 1) << i;
                nl >>= 1;
            }
            
            i++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
