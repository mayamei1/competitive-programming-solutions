## _Solution:_
Store each point into their respective $d=\max(x_i,y_i)$. Iterate through each $d$ in ascending order and iterate through each point in $d$. If at any point a letter has been visited again, then stop counting. If not, then add the number of points in $d$ and move onto the next $d$.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int d = max(abs(points[i][0]), abs(points[i][1]));
            dist[d].push_back(i);
        }

            for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
