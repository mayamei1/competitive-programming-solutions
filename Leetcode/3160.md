## _Solution:_
Keep track of hash-maps or RB-trees that keep track of the colors of the balls, and another to keep track of the frequency of each color. Then, simulate. If a ball already has a color, be sure to decrement the old color in the frequency. If the frequency goes down to 0, be sure to remove the color from the hash-map/RB-tree.

        map<int, int> freq;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x = queries[i][0], y = queries[i][1];
            if (colors.find(x) != colors.end()) {
                freq[colors[x]]--;
                if (freq[colors[x]] == 0) freq.erase(colors[x]);
            }
            
            colors[x] = y;
            freq[colors[x]]++;
            ans[i] = freq.size();
        }
