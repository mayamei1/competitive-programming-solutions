## _Solution:_
Observe that no matter how many moves are made, it is simply the last location's value minus the start location's value. Keep track of a DP table that contains the maximum value from $(i,j)$ to $(n,m)$. Then, for each location $(i,j)$, the best possible answer is `max(dp[i+1][j]+dp[i][j+1])-grid[i][j]`. Keep track of the maximum answer throughout each location.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp = grid;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (i != n - 1) {
                    if (dp[i + 1][j] > dp[i][j]) {
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j];
                    }
                }
                
                if (j != m - 1) {
                    if (dp[i][j + 1] > dp[i][j]) {
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j + 1];
                    }
