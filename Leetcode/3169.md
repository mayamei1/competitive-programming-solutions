## _Solution:_
Keep a sorted list of when meetings start/end. Iterate through each day and run through each event. If at the beginning of the day, the number of meetings is zero, then accumulate the number of days between the current day and the day of the last event.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDays(int days, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        int n = meetings.size();
        vector<pair<int,int>> events;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            events.push_back({meetings[i][0], 1});
            events.push_back({meetings[i][1], -1});
        }
        
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());
        
        int m = events.size();
        int h = 0, prev = 0, ans = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < m) {
            if (h == 0) {
                ans += events[i].first - prev - 1;
            }
            
            int j = i;
            while (j < m && events[i].first == events[j].first) {
                h += events[j].second;
                j++;
            }
            
            prev = events[i].first;
            i = j;
        }
        
        ans += days - events[m - 1].first;
        
        return ans;
    }
};
