#competitive-programming/greedy #competitive-programming/ds/priority-queue 
## _Solution:_
Alice's best moves are to eat cakes from lowest to highest. Bob's best moves are to try to take out numbers before Alice gets to them. If Alice has made $m$ moves, then Bob has $m-1$ moves to try to block out numbers. Count the frequency of every tastiness and iterate through each tastiness in increasing order. We will use a variable to keep track of the amount of moves used by Bob. Bob will greedily try to block the current tastiness. If there are enough moves left, have Bob eat all of the cakes of this tastiness. If there isn't, then Alice gets to eat another cake. We will also compare the tastiness with the largest frequency that Bob has previously taken with the current tastiness. If the frequency of the current is smaller, replace the larger frequency with this one, giving Bob back some moves. This can be done with the help of a priority queue.
