#competitive-programming/greedy 
## _Solution:_
You can greedily merge continuous groups of 0's into a single 0. Then, in order to remove any 0's, you must sacrifice two 1's and get back a 1, resulting in a net loss of one-to-one. Thus, as long as the initial number of ones is greater than the number of continuous groups of 0's, it is possible.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

#define ll long long
#define ull unsigned ll
#define vs vector<string>
#define dd int
#define ii pair<dd, dd>
#define vi vector<dd>
#define vii vector<ii>
#define vvi vector<vi>
#define vvii vector<vii>
#define umap unordered_map
#define uset unordered_set

void solve() {
    int n;

    char p = 0;
    int ones = 0, zeros = 0;
    for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {
        if (p == '0' && s[i] == '0') continue;
        if (s[i] == '0') zeros++;
        else ones++;
        p = s[i];
    }

    if (ones > zeros) cout << "Yes" << endl;
    else cout << "No" << endl;
}

    cin.tie(nullptr);
