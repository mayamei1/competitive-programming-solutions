#competitive-programming/greedy
## _Solution:_
You are able create a chain-reaction of using only a single type of operation if it is a bunch of `A`'s followed by a `B`, or a `B` followed by a bunch of `A`'s. In most cases, you will be able do the operation as many times as there is an `A`. If the first letter is a `B`, then it is such a case (a bunch of operation 2s). Same goes for if the last letter is a `B` (a bunch of operation 1s). And finally it is also the case if there is a group of two or more consecutive `B`'s (operation 1 to the left, operation 2 to the right). So, if none of these are the case, there is some group of `A`'s that can not be included, and we will want to greedily select the group with the smallest amount of `A`'s.
