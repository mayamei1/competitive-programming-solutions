#competitive-programming/binary-search 
## _Solution:_
Observe that operation $n$ does not affect the values at $1,\dots,n-1$. Thus, every integer from $1$ to $n$ will be constant no matter which value of $n$ we choose. In fact, the pattern that can be observed is one zero, two ones, one zero, four ones, one zero, six ones, and so on. Thus, we can binary search to find the maximum number of groups of ones such that it is less than or equal to $k$. Then, we fill in the remaining ones.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using dd = int;
using ii = pair<dd, dd>;
using vi =  vector<dd>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using vvii = vector<vii>;

void solve() {
    ll k;
    cin >> k;

    if (k == 1) {
        cout << 2 << endl;
        return;
    }

    ll l = 1, h = 1e9;
    while (h - l > 1) {
        ll m = (h - l) / 2 + l;
        if (m * (m + 1) <= k) l = m;
        else h = m;
    }


    ll ans = l + l * (l + 1);
    ll diff = k - (l * (l + 1));
    if (diff > 0) {
        ans += 1 + diff;
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) solve();
}
