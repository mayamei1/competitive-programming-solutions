## _Solution:_
Let's say that the max value has an odd frequency. You can guarantee that Alice will win by greedily picking the max value immediately. Otherwise, if Alice is the first to pick the max value, she will lose. To determine this, we can check the second largest value to see if that has an odd frequency, as it can guarantee that Bob will go first to pick the max value. If the second largest is still even, continue searching in decreasing order for any even frequency. Then, you can also observe that if **any** even frequency exists, then there Alice can always win.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using dd = int;
using ii = pair<dd, dd>;
using vi =  vector<dd>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using vvii = vector<vii>;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vi freq(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int ai;
        cin >> ai;
        freq[ai]++;
    }

    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        if (freq[i] % 2 == 1) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
            return;
        }
    }

    cout << "NO" << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) solve();
