#competitive-programming/greedy 
## _Solution:_
We can assign every index between $y$ and $x$ (inclusive) to be 1. Then, building out from that group, we can alternatively assign -1's and 1. The subsegment $(y,x)$ is at least 2, while the prefixes/suffixes that do not include this subsegment is at most 0. Including the subsegment breaks the -1/1 pattern, making the number positive, making the maximum prefix/suffix positions to be at the bounds of the subsegment.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using dd = int;
using ii = pair<dd, dd>;
using vi =  vector<dd>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using vvii = vector<vii>;

void solve() {
    int n, x, y;
    cin >> n >> x >> y;

    vi ans(n + 1);
    for (int i = y; i <= x; i++) ans[i] = 1;
    int v = -1;
    for (int i = y - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
        ans[i] = v;
        v *= -1;
    }
    v = -1;
    for (int i = x + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        ans[i] = v;
        v *= -1;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) solve();
}
