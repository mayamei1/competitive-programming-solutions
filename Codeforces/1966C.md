## _Solution:_
We only need to consider unique pile sizes. If the smallest pile is 1, then Alice is forced to make a 1 move. Then, if the second pile is 2, then Bob is forced to make a 1 move. This continues with 3 on. Otherwise, the player that makes the current move can guarantee a win. Say we are trying to perform move on pile $i$, and whoever starts with pile $i+1$ is guaranteed to win. Then, you can subtract off all but one from the current pile, forcing the other to subtract one, and you will start with pile $i+1$. Now, instead say that whoever starts pile $i+1$ is guaranteed to lose: you subtract off the entire pile, forcing your opponent to start with pile $i+1$. This gives us a DP recurrence that depends on if the size of the current pile is equal to $i$. If they are equal, then `dp[i]=!dp[i+1]`, otherwise `dp[i]=1`.
