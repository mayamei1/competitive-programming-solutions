## _Solution:_
Let's fix an arbitrary node to be the root. Let's also use DP/DFS to solve the problem. Each subtree $u$ will calculate/keep track of two values: the number of ways to have at most one node in the set for all paths starting from $u$, and the number of ways to have two nodes in the set for all paths starting from $u$. We denote these values $dp_{u,0}$ and $dp_{u,1}$. Then, to calculate these values, we use intermediary values $t_{0}=\prod\limits_{v}dp_{v,0}$ and $t_{1}=\sum\limits_{v}dp_{v,1}$ and $t_{2}=\sum\limits_{v}(dp_{v,0}-1)$. Then, $dp_{u,0}=t_{0}+1$ and $dp_{u,1}=t_{1}+t_{2}$. To prove why, let's consider if $u$ is or is not in the set. If $u$ is not in the set, then the number of ways to get at most one node if you take any path starting from $u$ is by every combination of each child's "at most one node paths," thus we can apply product rule. For "two nodes paths" when $u$ is not in the set, its when one child has "two nodes paths" and the rest has "zero node paths," and since there is exactly one "zero node paths," we simply add up "two node paths" of the children. If $u$ is in the set, then we can get a "one node path" by having all children be "zero node paths." And, we can get "two node paths" by picking one child to have a "one node path" (which is "at most one node paths" minus 1), and the rest have a "zero node path."
