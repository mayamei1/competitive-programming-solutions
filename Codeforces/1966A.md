## _Solution:_
If there is no number $x$ with at least $k$ cards, then the answer is trivially $n$. Otherwise, you can greedily turn $x$ into another number that exists. That way, it is guaranteed that this other number $y$ will have at least $k$ cards. Then, you can continue doing this until all numbers are the same, and from there, you can continue performing the operation and keeping the same number until there are only $k-1$ cards left.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using dd = int;
using ii = pair<dd, dd>;
using vi =  vector<dd>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using vvii = vector<vii>;

void solve() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    map<int, int> freq;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int a;
        cin >> a;

        freq[a]++;
    }

    bool flag = false;
    for (auto [x, f] : freq) {
        if (f >= k) flag = true;
    }

    if (flag) cout << k - 1 << endl;
    else cout << n << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) solve();
}
