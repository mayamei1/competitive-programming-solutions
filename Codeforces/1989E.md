## _Solution:_
Imagine $a$ as blocks of consecutive numbers. With the first block, you can easily determine the length of the block in $b$ as $n$, as the first $n$ numbers will be $n,n-1,\dots,2,1$. Same can be determined by the last block. As with blocks in the middle, you can also determine blocks of any size, except for 2, as it is indistinguishable from two blocks of 1. So it becomes a problem of counting up the number of ways to use at least $k$ blocks whose lengths add up to $n$, with the exception of sizes of two (except for the first and last blocks). This can be solved via DP, with two states, $i$ as the total length, and $j$ as the number of blocks used, keeping track of the count given the $j$-th block ends at $i$. Then, we can say that `dp[i][j+1]=sum(dp[0...i-1][j])`, and minus `dp[i-2][j]` to get rid of lengths of twos, but only if $2<i<n$.

We can optimize the DP by stating that $j=k$ instead keeps track of when it is at least $k$, while $j\ne k$ keeps track of exactly $j$. We can further optimize this by keeping track of running sums of `dp[0...i-1][j]`.
