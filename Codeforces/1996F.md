#competitive-programming/binary-search #competitive-programming/greedy 
## _Solution:_
We will greedily always want to take from the largest element. With that in mind, we can binary search some $x$ such that every element must be less than $x$. We can calculate the number of operations necessary to do so, and we can find the smallest $x$ such that the number of operations is at most $k$. It can then be observed that if there are operations that remain, they must be adding $x-1$. If no elements are $x-1$, then obviously this is not the smallest $x$. If the number of elements that are $x-1$ are less than or equal to the number of operations left, then we can perform operations on those $x-1$'s, and thus this is not the smallest $x$. Thus, there are more $x-1$'s than there are operations, and more importantly, all final operations are at $x-1$. Finding the final score can be done by solving $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}a_{i}-i\cdot(b_{i})=n\cdot{a_{i}}-b_{i}\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of operations necessary to make $a_i<x$.
