## _Solution:_
Let's define $x:=x+1$ and look for values strictly less than $x$. In order to generate a valid solution, there must be some bit $i$, such that all higher order bits in $x$ that are $0$ must have every subsegment's bit equal to $0$, and bit $i$ in every subsegment is also equal to $0$. Notice that you can still create valid partitions by also saying that lower order bits must be equal to $0$, however, doing so can only decrease the number subsegments. Now, in order to optimally select subsegments, simply merge ranges of adjacent pairs of $1$ bits at position $i$. Of course, if there is an odd number of $1$ bits, and the corresponding bit in $x$ is $0$, then there is no way to meet the requirement.
