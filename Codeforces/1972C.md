## _Solution:_
Observe that if every number $1\dots n$ have a minimum of $x$ cards, then you can order the $n\times x$ cards by $x$ of the same permutation in a row. Then, this is followed by as many cards as possible to try to make one more permutation. This results in $nx-m+1$, where $m$ is the number of cards with exactly $x$ cards. In terms of the $k$ extra cards, you always want to buy cards that have the minimum number of cards. However, $k$ can be large, so you can distribute $k$ in batches. Try to batch add to the lowest cards to reach the next smallest frequency. Keep doing this until there is only one frequency left, or if you don't have enough cards left that you could buy. With the remaining cards, you can always increase the score with each card.
