## _Solution:_
The optimal solution is to take as much from the largest count as possible. If one count is at least two times larger than the sum of the other two, then you can take two from the max count and one from the other, resulting in `sum-max` tables. Otherwise, you will always be able to make `sum/3` tables.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

#define ll long long
#define ull unsigned ll
#define vs vector<string>
#define dd int
#define ii pair<dd, dd>
#define vi vector<dd>
#define vii vector<ii>
#define vvi vector<vi>
#define vvii vector<vii>
#define umap unordered_map
#define uset unordered_set

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ll r, g, b;
    cin >> r >> g >> b;

    ll sum = r + g + b;
    ll mx = max(r, max(g, b));
    sum - mx;
    if ((sum - mx) > mx / 2) cout << sum / 3 << endl;
    else cout << sum - mx << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    solve();
}
