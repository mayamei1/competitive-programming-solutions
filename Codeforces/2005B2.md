## _Solution:_
Let's say David is to the left or to the right of *all* teachers. Then, it is optimal for David to move to the edge of the classroom, and the number of moves performed will be the distance of the closest teacher to that edge. Otherwise, the optimal move for David is to be in the middle of the two neighboring teachers. If we sort $b$, we can handle each query $a_i$ by performing binary search to find where David and the neighboring teachers.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

    int n, m, q;

    vi a(q);
    for (int& x : a) cin >> x;

    sort(b.begin(), b.end());

    for (int x : a) {
        auto itr = lower_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), x);
        if (itr == b.begin()) {
            cout << *b.begin() - 1 << endl;
