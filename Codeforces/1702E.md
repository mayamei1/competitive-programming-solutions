## _Solution:_
We can represent each number as a node, and a domino as an edge. We want to color each edge one of two colors, such that any node does not have two connected edges that are the same color. It can trivially be observed that any node must have at most two edges connected to it, otherwise it is impossible to split into two sets. This forces the graph to be a collection of simple paths or cycles. With simple paths, there will always be a way to color the edges to meet the condition. With simple cycles, if the length of the cycle is odd, then there is no way to meet the condition.
