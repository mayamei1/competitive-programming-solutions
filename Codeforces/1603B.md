## _Solution:_
If $x>y$, it is a trivial case, where $n=x+y$. With $x\le y$, $n$ needs to be some value $v$ more than a multiple of $x$, and $y$ also needs to be the same $v$ higher than $n$. This can be found by finding the closest multiple of $x$ (denoted $cx$) that is less than or equal to $y$. Then, since $x$ and $y$ are both even, the distance between $y$ and $cx$ must also be even. Thus, you can find the mid point of the two with $\frac{y-cx}{2}+cx$.
