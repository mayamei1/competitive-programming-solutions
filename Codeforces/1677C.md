## _Solution:_
Cycles will exist from taking one color $a_i$ and going to $b_i$, then from the color of $b_i$ at $a$ to the next $b$, and so on. The optimal way to assign values to each element in the cycle is maximum-minimum-maximum-minimum and so on. However, with odd sized cycles, the final element's value does not ultimately matter. When calculating the beauty of a single cycle, you can break up the sum as 2 times every "peak" and 2 times every "valley." Thus, if you have $s$ as the number of peaks (or number of valleys), simply calculated by $s=\sum\limits\lfloor{\frac{size}{2}}\rfloor$, then you can form maximum solution as the sum of the largest $s$ numbers and the smallest $s$ numbers, multiplied by two. This simplifies down to $2s(n-s)$.
