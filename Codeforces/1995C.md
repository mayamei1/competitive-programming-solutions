## _Solution:_
The obvious fail case is if $a_{i-1}>a_i=1$. Instead of actually performing the squaring (where you would have to deal with floating point, and they may have made test cases that prevents using that), you can instead keep track of the signed number of operations between adjacent pairs. Then, you can keep a running sum of number of operations, while keeping the sum at minimum 0. Basically, if instead of just squaring the single element, you square the suffix, and you can "take back" operations if initially $a_i$ is larger than $a_{i-1}^2$.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using dd = ll;
using ii = pair<dd, dd>;
using vi =  vector<dd>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using vvii = vector<vii>;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vi a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];

    ll ans = 0;
    ll cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] >= a[i - 1]) {
            ll t = a[i - 1];
            while (t * t <= a[i] && cnt) t *= t, cnt--;
        } else {
            if (a[i] == 1) {
                cout << -1 << endl;
                return;
            }
            ll t = a[i];
            while (t < a[i - 1]) t *= t, cnt++;
        }
        ans += cnt;
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) solve();
