## _Solution:_
Each interaction, which we will denote as $f(a,b)$ gives us the "middle vertex" between $a$ and $b$. Let's fix vertex 1 as the root, and from that, we can build up the known graph. Let's pick some vertex $v$ that is unknown. We can binary search to find the edge between the known part and the unknown part: we start of with $u=1$, and if $f(u,v)$ is is known, we set $u:=f(u,v)$, otherwise set $v:=f(u,v)$. We continue doing so, until the $f(u,v)$ returns $u$, giving us a new known edge. Continue doing so until the graph is known. Since $n$ is at most 1000, each new edge costs us $\log_2(1000)\approx10$ operations, and there are $n-1$ edges we need to find.
