## _Solution:_
Observe that you can use multiple operations in order to essentially one big operation denoted by $(i,j)$ such that ($1\le i\le j\le n$), where you subtract one from $a_{i}$ and add one to $a_{j}$. Now, let's iterate backwards in the array. We keep track of the frequency of each number in the suffix (after performing optimal moves). Say we are looking to add $a_{i}$ to the suffix. Let's find all the numbers that its optimal to perform operations on. Iterating through the smallest numbers in the frequency map, we check if the number is smaller than the average of the current set of numbers we operate on, and if so, we add it in. Then, after performing the operations, say with a sum of $s$ and a count of $c$, then we can add back in $\lfloor \frac{s}{c}\rfloor$ and $\lfloor \frac{s}{c}\rfloor+1$ to the frequency map.

    map<ll, ll> freq;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        ll sum = a[i], cnt = 1;
        auto itr = freq.begin();
        while (itr != freq.end() && itr->first <= sum / cnt) {
            sum += itr->first * itr->second;
            cnt += itr->second;
            itr++;

        freq.erase(freq.begin(), itr);
        ll val = sum / cnt;
        ll rem = sum % cnt;
        if (rem) freq[val + 1] += rem;
        freq[val] += cnt - rem;
    }

    ll mx = freq.rbegin()->first;
    ll mn = freq.begin()->first;
    cout << (mx - mn) << endl;
