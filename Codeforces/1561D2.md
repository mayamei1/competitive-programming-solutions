## _Solution:_
Say we are currently looking for how many ways to get to cell $i$, which we will denote as $f(i)$, and we have calculated the number of ways for every cell above $i$. With the subtraction operation, there is one way to get from every higher cell to $i$, thus $\sum\limits_{k=i+1}^{n}f(k)$. With the division operation, there are $\frac{n}{i}$ viable values for $z$ for any number to get to $i$. With each $z$, there exists a range of numbers that, if integer divided by $z$, will result in $i$. This range can be calculated in constant time with $l=i\cdot z$ and $h=\min(n, i\cdot (z+1)-1)$, inclusive. Thus, for some $z$, we need to also add $\sum\limits_{k=l}^{h}f(k)$. Both of these sums can be computed in constant time if we keep track of a suffix/prefix sum.
