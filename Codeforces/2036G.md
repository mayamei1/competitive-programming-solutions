#competitive-programming/binary-search #competitive-programming/interactive 
## _Solution:_
Let's assume $a<b<c$. Let's consider two cases: the XOR of the three values is non-zero, or the XOR is zero. For the first case, we can simply binary search to find the lower bound where $\mathrm{xor(1,m)}$ stays non-zero to find $a$. Then, binary search to find the upper bound where $\mathrm{xor(m,n)}$ stays non-zero to find $c$, and $b$ can be found by XOR-ing with $\mathrm{xor}(1,n)=a\oplus b\oplus c$. For the second case, observe that $b$ and $c$ must have the same highest order bit, while $a$ must have a smaller highest order bit. Thus, we can check every $2^{i}$, and when we come across an $\mathrm{xor(2^{i},n)}\ne 0$, then that query gives the answer to $b\oplus c=a$. Then, we can binary search between $(2^{i},n)$ to find out $c$, and $b$ can be found the same way as the first case.
