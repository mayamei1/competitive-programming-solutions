## _Solution:_
The final result of each person should be $s=\frac{\sum\limits{a}}{n}$. So,  $g_{i}+a_{i}-t_{i}=s$ for every $i$, where $g_i$ denotes the amount given to $i$ and $t_i$ denotes the amount taken from $i$. Thus, $g_{i}-t_{i}=s-a_{i}$. Since $g_i$ and $t_i$ must be powers of twos, the difference between $a_i$ and the average must be a difference of powers of twos. Difference of powers of twos can be denoted in binary as a single continuous group of 1, where the least significant one denotes the power of the negative component and the most significant one plus 1 denotes the power of the positive component. Depending on if $a_i$ is above or below the average, set the $g_i$ and $t_i$ accordingly, then finally ensure the count of give and take are equal at each power.
