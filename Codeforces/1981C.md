## _Solution:_
Let's consider the range $(l,r)$ where every element except $l$ and $r$ are $-1$. We can think of the problem as making exactly $r-l-1$ operations to try turning $a_{l}$ to $a_{r}$. WLOG, assume $a_{l}<a_{r}$. And each operation is either $a_{l}$ shifted down 1 bit, or $a_{l}$ shifted up one bit and you can choose to toggle bit 0. The minimum number of moves needed to do so is done by first shifting down $a_{l}$ until $a_{l}$ is a prefix of $a_{r}$. Then, shift it up, filling in the bits, until it matches $a_{r}$. If there are still operations left, it can be filled with alternating shifting up and down. The fail cases is when you either run out of operations, or the number of operations after the minimum is odd parity. However, you can simply have it "try its best," and check afterwards if it fails. As for ranges where it is on the boundary, it can trivially be done by just following the rules.
