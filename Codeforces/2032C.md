## _Solution:_
Let's say that we are trying to replace some set of elements, since the numbers prevent non-degenerative triangles. It is optimal to set them to the same element. In fact, if we have some set that does not create triangles, then we can set it all the "bad" elements equal to the minimum in the set. To do this efficiently, we first sort the elements, then we can simply iterate through the element that we consider the minimum. Any element smaller than the minimum must be replaced, and we can use binary search or a two pointer solution to find the largest element that can be part of the set.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using dd = int;
using ii = pair<dd, dd>;
using vi =  vector<dd>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using vvii = vector<vii>;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vi a(n);
    for (int& x : a) cin >> x;

    sort(a.begin(), a.end());

    int ans = 1e9;
    int r = 0;
    for (int l = 0; l < n - 1; l++) {
        while (r < n && a[l] + a[l + 1] > a[r]) r++;
        ans = min(ans, l + (n - r));
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) solve();
}
