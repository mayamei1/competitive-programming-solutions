#competitive-programming/greedy
## _Solution:_
Any move can technically be made by doing any combination of the 2-by-2 move with $\begin{bmatrix}1 2 \\ 2 1\end{bmatrix}$. First, observe that the other 2-by-2 move can be done by performing the operation two times at the same location. Then, in order to create larger sub-rectangles, we will first focus on one dimension. If you do a move at $(i,j)$, then at $(i+1,j)$, it effectively made the 3-by-2 operation. This can then be extended to do any n-by-2 operation. Now, with any n-by-2 rectangle, we can perform operations at $(x,j+1)$ (where $x$ is every point directly under the rectangle, except the right most one) to make it at n-by-3 rectangle. Once again, we can extend this further to be a n-by-m rectangle. Since every operation can be performed by some series of a single operation, we can greedily try to iterate top-down then left-right, and at each position perform the operation as many times needed to set the current value equal to the desired value. Of course, the operation can not be performed at the right most column and the bottom most row.
