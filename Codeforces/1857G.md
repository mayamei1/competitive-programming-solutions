## _Solution:_
First, let's sort each edge by its weight to get an order that the MST would have been generated. Iterate through each edge $(u,v,w)$. This edge will connect two components of size $p$ and $q$, which can be kept track of via disjoint set. We will assume that at this point, potential edges within a component is already accounted for. Thus, the potential edges we need to worry about is between the two components. Specifically, there are $pq-1$ edges that we need to consider (since one edge is being used to connect the two components). The possible states for these $pq-1$ edges is that it doesn't exist or it is a number between $w+1$ and $s$ inclusive, or more formally, $\max(0,s-w)+1$ possibilities. This gives us $(\max(0,s-w)+1)^{(pq-1)}$ possibilities across all of possible edges. We multiply all of these values across all edges in the tree to get the final answer.
