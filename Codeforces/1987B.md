## _Solution:_
For any value $a_i$ that is smaller than the value to its left, you will need to increase it to by $a_{i-1}-a_i$. However, since each operation also costs one extra coin, we will also use as many of these operations for any other $a_j$'s that need to be increased as well. Let's say at any point, the maximum we have ever increased any $a_i$ is $m$. Then, if $a_i$ needs to be increased by at most $m$, no extra operations are needed, and we simply add the amount we need to increase $a_{i-1}-a_i$ to the final answer. Else, we will need to add $a_{i-1}-a_i-m$ operations, meaning we increase by $a_{i-1}-a_i$ as well as $a_{i-1}-a_i-m$.
