#competitive-programming/greedy 
## _Solution:_
If the first 1 bit in $s$ occurs after the first 1 bit in $t$, then it is impossible. Say we have some arbitrary amount of 0's followed by a 1 in $s$. Then, any bit afterwards can be toggled via that 1 bit. However, any bits to the left of that one can not be toggled, so if there exists a difference between $s$ and $t$ before that $1$, there is no way to fix it. And since the bits to the left of the 1 must be 0, the difference must be a 1 bit in $t$.
