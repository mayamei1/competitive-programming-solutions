#competitive-programming/constructive-algorithm 
## _Solution:_
Let's say there is one $1$ and the rest are $0$'s. Then, the number of subsequences with only $0$'s is $2^{n-1}-1$. The number of subsequences with a one must include that singular $1$, and we can count the same number of subsequences of the rest, which is only $0$'s, therefore, it also has $2^{n-1}-1$ subsequences.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
using dd = int;
using ii = pair<dd, dd>;
using vi =  vector<dd>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using vvii = vector<vii>;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    cout << 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) cout << 0;
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) solve();
}
