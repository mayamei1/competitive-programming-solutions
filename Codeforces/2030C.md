#competitive-programming/greedy 
## _Solution:_
Note that it is always optimal for Alice to place $\mathrm{or}$'s, while Bob places $\mathrm{and}$'s. It can be observed that Alice can win in three cases. There is a $1$ at the beginning: Alice places an $\rm{or}$ between $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$. There is a $1$ at the end: Alice places an $\mathrm{or}$ between $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n}$. There exists an $a_{i}$ and $a_{i+1}$ such that both are $1$. In this case, Alice places an $\mathrm{or}$ between $a_{i-1}$ and $a_{i}$. Then, say Bob places an $\mathrm{and}$ between $a_{i}$ and $a_{i+1}$, then Alice can place an $\mathrm{or}$ between $a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i+2}$, guaranteeing a win. If instead, Bob placed the $\mathrm{and}$ between $a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i+2}$, then Alice can place an $\mathrm{or}$ between $a_{i}$ and $a_{i+1}$. Any other moves Bob makes could not change the outcome.
