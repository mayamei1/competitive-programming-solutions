## _Solution:_
First, let's sort the set and ensure that each number is unique. The total number of combinations of $x$ and $y$ with an empty set is $\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$, we we initially set the answer to that. For each number $a_{i}$, consider the range of $x$ such that there exists a $0\le y\le a_{i}$ where $x+y=a_{i}$. This range is between $[0,\lfloor \frac{a_{i}}{2}\rfloor]$, so we subtract $\lfloor \frac{a_{i}}{2}\rfloor$ from the answer. Then, consider the range of $x$ such that there exists a $a_{i}< y\le c$ where $x-y=a_{i}$. This range has $y$ between $[0,c-a_{i}-1]$, thus we subtract $c-a_{i}$ from the answer. Graphically, you can see that any $a_{i}$ will intersect with every $a_{j}$ ($j<i$) such that $a_{i}\equiv a_{j}\mod{2}$, so we would accidentally double count subtracting that intersection. We can simply keep track of a count of elements of even/odd parity up to $i-1$, and add back the value accordingly.
