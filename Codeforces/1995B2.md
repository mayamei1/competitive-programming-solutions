## _Solution:_
Say we are checking the max answer for some pair $a$ and $a+1$, with frequency $f_0$ and $f_1$. If $af_0+(a+1)f_{1}\le m$, we can simply take all flowers. Otherwise, we will need to calculate the largest value smaller than $m$. Start by finding the maximum number of $a$ that is still smaller than $m$. Then, if it is possible to continue with adding $a+1$ without going over $m$, do so. Then, we can swap out $a$'s with $a+1$'s in order to get closer to $m$. Say we added $c_0$ $a$'s and $c_1$ $a+1$'s, and currently have a sum of $s$. The number of swaps that can be made is $\min(m-s,c_0,c_1)$.
