## _Solution:_
The equivalent problem is to find the contribution of each divisor, which can be found as $\lfloor\frac{n}{i}\rfloor$. It should also be observed that there are at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ unique $\lfloor\frac{n}{i}\rfloor$. The ranges for a unique value can be found mathematically. Say we had the smallest number in the range, $l$, then we assign $k=\lfloor\frac{n}{i}\rfloor$. We would want to spread $k$ across $n$ evenly as far as possible, thus, we get that $r=\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor$. With a given range, you can calculate the sum of numbers between $l$ and $r$ and multiply it by $k$. Normally, inverse mod should be $O(\log{n})$, but since we only need to find the inverse of 2, we can store it as a constant.
